Before product can be sold legally, it is necessary to register a business (costs 26 €) (see here: https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/121921/).
As far as I remember, registering the business also informs the Finanzamt and a Steuernummer is sent.
But it is also possible to just inform the Finanzamt yourself (~).
Also a EU-Steuernummer (~) can be requested from the Finanzamt.
The EU-Steuernummer is useful to do business outside of Germany.
to do business: buy or sell products.
~: approximately

Probably also it is necessary to inform the Jobcenter about the registered business and the income source (~).
Clarify uncertainties.
