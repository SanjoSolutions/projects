Dear Jason,

$1 writing to resign my position as customer service representative, effective August 15, 2018.

$0 recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. $1 tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.

$0 truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn and such a positive, inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.

$1 particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me.

Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.

Thanks, and best wishes,



Nicole Thomas
